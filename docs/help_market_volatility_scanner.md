### 📊 How to Interpret Statistical Analysis Results

The **Statistical Analysis** module within the Market & Volatility Scanner presents a rich, multidimensional profile of the selected asset. It surfaces descriptive properties, performance metrics, risk-adjusted measures, and intermarket relationships to help identify noteworthy conditions or structural anomalies — not to issue direct signals.

The data provided is structured to support:

- **Situational awareness** of current asset characteristics
- **Comparative positioning** across market types or timeframes
- **Alignment and contradiction checks** against other modules (e.g., price action, correlation, macro)

Below is a breakdown of the analysis sections available:

---

### 🧮 Descriptive Statistics

These establish the foundational distributional properties of the asset’s return and price behaviour.

- **Measure of Central Tendency**: Mean, median, and mode — offer insight into average behaviour.
- **Measures of Dispersion**: Standard deviation, variance, and range — reflect volatility and uncertainty.
- **Measures of Shape**: Skewness and kurtosis — reveal asymmetry and tail risk.
- **Basic Statistics**: Min, max, count — quick reference for historical extremes.
- **Frequency Distribution**: Visual breakdown of how returns are distributed over time.

📌 *Use Case*: Understand historical behaviour to frame expectations and detect anomalies.

---

### ⚖️ Risk & Uncertainty Analysis

These modules translate market behaviour into uncertainty-adjusted outcomes.

- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Projects a range of future price paths based on historical volatility.
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns (Sharpe Ratio)**: Reward per unit of total risk.
- **Downside Risk Measure (Sortino Ratio)**: Reward per unit of downside-only risk.
- **Probability of Hitting DPT**: Likelihood of reaching a defined price target.

📌 *Use Case*: Assess potential reward vs. risk and explore price path distributions.

---

### 📊 Market Dynamics

These track evolving volatility and intra-asset behaviour.

- **Volatility Ratio**: Compares short-term to long-term volatility to assess regime change.
- **ATR (Average True Range)**: Measures typical price movement magnitude — often used to size stops or targets.

📌 *Use Case*: Detect shifts in market environment or underlying asset temperament.

### 📈 Performance Metrics & Correlations

This area dissects how the asset has performed historically and in relation to key macro groupings.

#### 📉 Performance Analysis

- **Annualised Return**, **Maximum Drawdown**, **Volatility-Adjusted Return**, **Return on Investment (ROI)**, **Volume vs ATR Correlation**.

📌 *Use Case*: Evaluate total return characteristics, peak losses, and volume-led movement.

#### 🔗 Correlation & Causation Analysis

Examines historical relationships with external asset groups.

- **Correlation with...**: Major indices, FX pairs, crypto, commodities, ETFs (by theme and geography), and bonds (short/long).
- **Correlation with User Uploads**: Enables direct cross-check with user data.

📌 *Use Case*: Identify directional comovement, hedging candidates, or systemic exposure.

📍 *Reminder*: Correlation ≠ causation. High correlation may indicate relationship, not influence.

---

### 🌪 Volatility & Opportunity Mapping

These modules extend correlation logic into volatility space — mapping the co-behaviour of uncertainty.

- **Volatility with...**: Same groupings as above, focused on standard deviation movement patterns.

📌 *Use Case*: Discover which assets share volatility shocks — useful in stress tests or regime shifts.

---

### 📉 Data Visualisation Panels

Enables quick diagnostic through visual overlays.

#### 📌 Price Movement & Trend

- **Line**, **Candlestick**, and **Trend (Area)** views to inspect recent price dynamics.

#### 📈 Returns

- **Returns with...** (by group) — tracks performance alignment.
- **Cumulative Returns**, **Rolling Returns** — explore compounding and momentum.

#### ⚖️ Risk-Return & Opportunity

- **Risk-Return Grid**: Plots trade-off between average return and volatility.
- **DPT vs Volatility**: Shows how often an asset reaches a defined price threshold in relation to its volatility regime.

📌 *Use Case*: Spot asset behaviour profiles — stable performers, high-risk movers, or breakout candidates.

### 🧠 Interpretation Summary

- These metrics are **not recommendations**.
- They support **framing, filtering, and hypothesis generation**.
- Used together, they help identify:
  - Statistical outliers
  - Structural shifts in volatility
  - Alignment with external markets
  - Changing risk-reward asymmetries
