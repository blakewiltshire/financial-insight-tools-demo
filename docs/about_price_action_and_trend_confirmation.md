### 📖 What is this app about?

The **Price Action & Trend Confirmation** module analyses the technical structure of an asset's recent behaviour. It identifies breakout zones, trend strength, and potential reversal points to validate trade scenarios under consideration.

### Key functions include:

- Detection of breakout and consolidation patterns
- Trend scoring via slope, consistency, and price structure
- Analysis of support, resistance, and exhaustion levels
- Overlay diagnostics for short-term confirmation vs long-term trend

Designed for use in conjunction with trade structuring or timing modules, this tool emphasises scenario clarity rather than predictive interpretation.

### ⚠️ No investment advice or recommendations are provided

This module supports structured planning and diagnostic exploration. Interpretive judgement, scenario assumptions, and execution decisions remain the responsibility of the end user. No trading signals or investment recommendations are produced by this system.
