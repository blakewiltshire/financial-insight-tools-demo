### 📖 What is this app about?

The **Trade Timing & Confirmation** module evaluates technical alignment prior to trade initiation. It assesses confluence between price action, momentum signals, and trend consistency to support structurally disciplined entry decisions.

### Key components include:

- Cross-verification of multiple timing signals (e.g. RSI, MACD, EMA crossover)
- Confluence scoring to evaluate strength of alignment
- Divergence and exhaustion detection
- Optional tagging of setups for trade planning

This module supports decision-readiness without simulating execution or making directional forecasts.

### ⚠️ No investment advice or recommendations are provided

This module supports structured planning and diagnostic exploration. Interpretive judgement, scenario assumptions, and execution decisions remain the responsibility of the end user. No trading signals or investment recommendations are produced by this system.
